## About
### Non-technical
This little utility was born out of the [Hill Holliday][2] Digital Innovation and Technology (DOIT) team moving to the 35th floor to work more closely with the Creative team. We hope that we can get the creative juices flowing between our two teams even when we're not at our computers by displaying what everyone is working on as our screensavers. 
### Technical
The app is composed of three parts:
1. The custom API built off of [dribbble's][3] own API that pulls in our creative data. 
2. The animation and scaffolding ([React][4] webapp) that rotates through each Dribbble Shot.
3. The screensaver (`.saver`) file that pulls the React webapp through a WebkitView (generated from [@rsms's snarky project][5]).
